# Real-Time-scene-text-detection-and-recognition

This project presents real-time both EAST text detection and OCR text recognition with OpenCV, Python, and Tesseract. Experimental results show the analysis of EAST text detection with OCR text recognition. We adopted EAST with rotated rectangle geometry combine with tesseract and OpenCV on our real-time scene text detector. The method can detect words or words correctly and gives acceptable results for recognition while running at an average speed 3fps
